Other access arrangements, particularly supervised rest breaks, should be identified to make this arrangement unnecessary.\n\n### Examples – extra time (learning difficulties)\n\n#### A candidate not awarded extra time\n- Although there is not a picture of need, 25% extra time is not the candidate's normal way of working and Part 1 of Form 8 cannot be completed, a Year 11 GCSE student still has an assessment. This identifies that his underlying cognitive abilities fall in the upper range, with a score of 125. His literacy skills are within the average range and his cognitive processing scores are in the range of 94-96. An application for 25% extra time **cannot** be pursued as he **does not meet** the published criteria.\n\n#### A candidate with no previous history of need for GCSE examinations\n- Following feedback from the candidate's subject teachers during Year 12, the SENCo decides to trial and monitor 25% extra time and records its impact and use. By the March of Year 13, a picture of need and evidence of normal way of working has been firmly established. The SENCo, having collected data throughout the monitoring period, can complete Part 1 of Form 8. The candidate is then assessed by the centre's appointed assessor who confirms cognitive processing/fluency scores in the below average range (standardised scores of 80 and 83). The SENCo processes an online application for 25% extra time.\n\n#### Using evidence of cognitive processing difficulties\n- A GCSE student has an assessment which confirms the presence of a weak, below average working memory and below average phonological processing speed (standardised scores of 77 and 82). Her teachers have already observed that she is slow at gathering her thoughts and putting them down onto paper, especially under the timed conditions of an examination. They confirm she regularly needs verbal instructions repeated. Class test papers additionally show that the quality and quantity of her written answers improve significantly with the allowance of 25% extra time. The SENCo processes an online application for 25% extra time based on her two below average standardised scores, as recorded within Part 2 of Form 8, as well as the **picture of need** recorded within Part 1 of Form 8.\n\n2\n50",

        "text": "For those centres that accept entries from private candidates, the SENCo **must** also refer to the JCQ document *An overview of the access arrangements and reasonable adjustments process for centres accepting private candidates*:\nhttp://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/access-arrangements-and-special-consideration\n\n**NB** Where reference is made to an assessment ‘no earlier than the start of Year 9’, for candidates in Northern Ireland this would be Year 10.\n\nIn Wales, a **current** Individual Development Plan (IDP) which confirms the candidate’s disability has the same status as a **current** Education, Health and Care Plan (England) or a current Statement of special educational needs (Northern Ireland).\n\nWhere reference is made to ‘standardised scores’, these are standard scores which use a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.\n\n## 5.1 SUPERVISED REST BREAKS\n\nThere **is not** a requirement to process an application for supervised rest breaks using Access arrangements online. However, for GCSE and GCE AS and A level qualifications, the SENCo **must** complete the statement within either Part 1 of Form 8 or Part 1 of Form 9, confirming the need for supervised rest breaks.\n\nPart 1 of Form 8 will be used to confirm the need for supervised rest breaks for those candidates with learning difficulties who also require 25% extra time and/or a scribe.\n\nThe SENCo **must** confirm the nature of the candidate’s impairment and that supervised rest breaks reflect their normal way of working within the centre. A JCQ Centre Inspector may ask to see the completed Form 8 or Form 9 supporting the awarding of supervised rest breaks.\n\nSpecialist evidence is not required for inspection purposes.\n\nWhere a candidate has an impairment other than a learning difficulty, the SENCo **must** ~~have trialled and exhausted~~ the option of supervised rest breaks through timed internal tests and/or mock examinations before making an application for 25% extra time.\n\n~~Supervised rest breaks are often more effective and appropriate than 25% extra time for candidates who experience anxiety or attention difficulties. They may better address the needs of neurodivergent candidates, such as those with ADHD or ASD, as well as candidates with medical conditions or mental health needs. For a candidate who tires easily or struggles to concentrate over an extended period, supervised rest breaks will be more appropriate than 25% extra time.~~\n\n~~Allocating extra time simply extends the period a candidate must remain in a potentially stressful environment, which can intensify anxiety and reduce productivity. Moreover, 25% extra time may not address the underlying issue, which is often related to difficulties with attention or emotional regulation. In contrast, supervised rest breaks allow the candidate to step away from the exam setting, use structured self-regulation strategies and return when they are calm and better able to focus. This targeted approach can lead to more effective exam performance while also supporting the development of long-term self-management skills. Teaching candidates how to use these strategies equips them to advocate for themselves in further education or the workplace, fostering independence and resilience.~~\n\nSome candidates may additionally require 25% extra time.\n\n38",

The purpose of a supervised rest break is to provide a break from the examination and **must not** be used as 'thinking time'.\n\nIf the candidate needs to leave the examination room, an invigilator **must** accompany them.\n\nA single supervised rest break should normally be no more than 30 minutes in duration. A supervised rest break will often be shorter than this. Candidates **cannot** be given as many supervised rest breaks as they like for as long as they like. A supervised rest break will not normally be required within the first 10 minutes of an examination but may be thereafter.\n\nThe duration of the supervised rest break **must** be determined by the SENCo based on their knowledge of the candidate's needs and the candidate's normal way of working when placed under timed conditions. It may be helpful to consider in advance of the examination(s) how many breaks a candidate might need and the approximate duration of each supervised rest break. This will allow sufficient staff to be available to facilitate each rest break.\n\n5.1.3 There will be some constraints on timing if the candidate has more than one examination to take each day.\n\nWhere a candidate requires supervised rest breaks and extra time, the supervised rest break(s) may be taken at any point during the examination.\n\n**In cases of serious illness, centres must seek medical advice on whether the candidate is fit to take the examination.**\n\n39",

Form 8 **must be supplemented by samples of evidence** – see below.\n\n#### 5.2.2.1 Substantial impairment\n\nSo as not to give an unfair advantage, Part 2 of Form 8 **must** confirm that the candidate has at least:\n\n*   two below average standardised scores of 84 or less; **or**\n*   one below average standardised score of 84 or less **and** one low average standardised score (85-89).\n\nIn either scenario, the two standardised scores **must** relate to two different areas of speed of working, as below:\n\n*   speed of reading **and** speed of writing; **or**\n*   speed of reading **and** cognitive processing/fluency; **or**\n*   speed of writing **and** cognitive processing/fluency; **or**\n*   **two different areas** of cognitive processing/fluency which have a substantial and long-term adverse effect on speed of working.\n\nAn assessment of mathematical fluency **must only** be used as one of the two required measures for 25% extra time in Mathematics examinations. The mathematical fluency score **must** be below average. An assessment of mathematical fluency **can only** contribute to the evidence for 25% extra time in Mathematics examinations.\n\n40",
