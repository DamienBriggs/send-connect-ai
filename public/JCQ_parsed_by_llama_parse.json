For the attenti\n                                                                                                        within schools\n\n         This chapter relates specifically to Vocational Technical Qualifications as defined in section\n         54 of the Equality Act 2010.\n\n 2.2     AWARDING BODIES – VOCATIONAL TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS\n\n         Section 53 of the Equality Act 2010 states that when assessing candidates and conferring\n         Vocational Technical Qualifications, awarding bodies must not discriminate, harass or     Produced on behalf o\n         victimise and have a duty to make reasonable adjustments.\n\n 2.3     WHAT ARE THE DUTIES OF AWARDING BODIES?\n\n         The duty for an awarding body to make a reasonable adjustment will apply where an\n         assessment arrangement would put a disabled person at a\n         substantial disadvantage in\n         comparison to someone who is not disabled. In such circumstances, the awarding body\n         is required to take reasonable steps to avoid that disadvantage. Awarding bodies  are\n         not required to make adjustments to the academic or any other competence standard\n         being applied when conducting an examination/assessment.\n\n 2.4     APPLICATION OF COMPETENCE STANDARDS\n\n         Awarding bodies offering Vocational Technical Qualifications are allowed to apply\n         competence standards to a disabled person. (This equally applies to general qualifications.)\n\n         A competence standard is defined as an academic, medical or other standard applied for\n         the purpose of determining whether or not a person has a particular level of competence\n         or ability.\n\n         The application by an awarding body of a competence standard to a disabled person\n         does not constitute disability discrimination, unless it amounts to indirect discrimination\n         under section 19 of the Equality Act 2010.\n\n 2.5     TAKING ADVICE FROM THE AWARDING BODY ABOUT COMPETENCE\n         STANDARDS\n\n         There are subject-specific issues relating to Vocational Technical Qualifications where\n         the centre may need to seek advice from the awarding body issuing the qualification.\n\n         In many Vocational Technical Qualifications a wide range of reasonable adjustments\n         will be available. The arrangements listed in Chapters 5 and 6 may be relevant for some\n         candidates entering for Vocational Technical Qualifications.\n\n         However, there are some important exceptions where the competence standards would be\n         invalidated if an adjustment was made. Reasonable adjustments to Vocational Technical\n         Qualifications that carry a ‘licence to practise’ need to be carefully considered so as not\n         to invalidate ‘the licence’.\n\n 23",

There is no duty to make adjustments which the                 Produced on behalf o\n                 qualifications regulators have specified should not be made.\n\nExamples of how assessment objectives would impact on the availability of access\narrangements/reasonable adjustments\n\n•     A candidate with cerebral palsy enjoys her GCSE Design and Technology course but cannot\n      use her hands. She cannot design or make any realisation independently, even with the\n      aid of CAD/CAM. As this part of the assessment is a large proportion of the qualification,\n      she decides not to enter for this subject. The assessment objectives are designing and\n      making, so no adjustment can be made.\n\n•     A candidate with dyslexia wants to take GCSE English Language and GCSE Spanish but\n      cannot read or write adequately. He cannot have an adjustment in the form of a reader in the\n      Reading section of the GCSE English Language paper or the GCSE Spanish Reading paper\n      but may use a computer reader. He cannot have a scribe for GCSE Spanish examinations\n      unless he is able to dictate each foreign word letter by letter. It may be appropriate to\n      enter the candidate for GCSE Spanish if, with extra time of up to 50% or the use of a\n      word processor with the spelling and grammar check switched off, he can access the\n      examinations independently. He can, however, have a scribe in the Reading and Writing\n      sections of the GCSE English Language paper. (In an examination assessing the quality\n      of written communication or spelling, punctuation and grammar, where a scribe is used,\n      marks can only be awarded if the candidate can demonstrate that they have carried out\n      the skills being assessed.)\n\n•     A candidate with no hands wishes to take GCE A level Fine Art. It is suggested that mouth\n      or foot painting will be acceptable. The candidate cannot do either and wants another\n      person to paint at her instruction. This is not permitted, as the assessment includes the\n      skill of painting.\n\n29",

There is no duty to make adjustments which the qualifications regulators have specified should not be made.\n\n# Examples of how assessment objectives would impact on the availability of access arrangements/reasonable adjustments\n\n- A candidate with cerebral palsy enjoys her GCSE Design and Technology course but cannot use her hands. She cannot design or make any realisation independently, even with the aid of CAD/CAM. As this part of the assessment is a large proportion of the qualification, she decides not to enter for this subject. The assessment objectives are designing and making, so no adjustment can be made.\n- A candidate with dyslexia wants to take GCSE English Language and GCSE Spanish but cannot read or write adequately. He cannot have an adjustment in the form of a reader in the Reading section of the GCSE English Language paper or the GCSE Spanish Reading paper but may use a computer reader. He cannot have a scribe for GCSE Spanish examinations unless he is able to dictate each foreign word letter by letter. It may be appropriate to enter the candidate for GCSE Spanish if, with extra time of up to 50% or the use of a word processor with the spelling and grammar check switched off, he can access the examinations independently. He can, however, have a scribe in the Reading and Writing sections of the GCSE English Language paper. (In an examination assessing the quality of written communication or spelling, punctuation and grammar, where a scribe is used, marks can only be awarded if the candidate can demonstrate that they have carried out the skills being assessed.)\n- A candidate with no hands wishes to take GCE A level Fine Art. It is suggested that mouth or foot painting will be acceptable. The candidate cannot do either and wants another person to paint at her instruction. This is not permitted, as the assessment includes the skill of painting.\n\n",

However, if the candidate also wants to use predictive text and/or the spelling and grammar check facility, he must meet the published criteria for a scribe, with an approved application in place.\n\n",

However, using a\n      word processor is her normal way of working within the centre . When typing she can\n      produce her written work effectively. The SENCo awards the use of a word processor, as it       Instruct\n      removes the barrier presented by her slow handwriting. The SENCo will consider whether\n      25% extra time is required when she writes by hand, such as in GCSE Mathematics and\n      Science examinations. The candidate’s cognitive processing will need to be assessed, as she     1 September\n      will require two below average standardised scores or one below average standardised score\n      and one low average standardised score to be awarded 25% extra time.

The centre must then make an online referral to the relevant awarding body who will consider the application in light of the candidate’s needs.\n\nA Language Modifier should be a rare and exceptional arrangement. It must only be considered for those candidates whose disability has a very substantial and long-term adverse effect resulting in very persistent and significant difficulties in accessing and processing information.\n\nA Language Modifier is an adjustment of the last resort. An application should only be made once all other relevant adjustments have been considered and found to be unsuitable or unworkable. There must be a very strong justification as to why a Language Modifier is required.\n\n# 5.11.2 Substantial impairment – suitability and evidence of need\n\nAs part of the supporting evidence to an awarding body, the candidate must have a standardised score of 69 or less (a very substantially below average standardised score) in relation to reading comprehension and/or vocabulary. The candidate will have been assessed using current editions of nationally standardised tests conducted within 26 months of the final examination. (The candidate may be assessed by a Qualified Teacher of Deaf Children and Young People who will record the results of their assessment within Part 2 of Form 8.)\n\nThe extensive modification of language must reflect the candidate’s normal way of working within the centre, as evidenced within Part 1 of Form 8.\n\nAn awarding body reserves the right to request ‘call-in’ evidence from the centre.\n\n# 5.11.3 A Language Modifier\n\nA Language Modifier is an appropriate and responsible adult who may clarify the instructions used in the examination paper when requested to do so by a candidate.\n\nThe Language Modifier must not explain technical terms or subject-specific terms. The ability to understand these terms is part of the assessment. If such terms are explained to the candidate, then the demands of the question will have been compromised, which may constitute malpractice. (See The rules – the use of a Language Modifier within this section.)\n\n",

They must not sign off assessments carried out by another professional.\n\n# 7.5.5\n\nThe assessor must carry out tests which are relevant to support the application.\n\n# 7.5.6\n\nCurrent editions of nationally standardised tests which produce standardised scores must be used, where published.\n\n# 7.5.7\n\nWhere a computer-based assessment tool is used to gather assessment evidence for Part 2 of Form 8, a suitably qualified assessor (see paragraph 7.3.4) must be present to oversee the test’s computerised administration, actively observe the candidate and monitor the candidate’s engagement with the assessment.\n\n# 7.5.8\n\nThe candidate’s chronological age must be less than the ‘ceiling’ of the test, unless there is no published test for the candidate’s age.\n\n",
